So it's been a while since I've written a post, but a lot has also happened in the world in the meantime: namely, a global pandemic. In other news, I graduated from my master's program and am back in the healthcare tech industry, so that's fun!

I wanted to get an opportunity to write about new topics that weren't related to healthcare and data science (I'll still write about that stuff, inevitably), so my mind went to a website that I used to visit as a kid: StumbleUpon.

Lo and behold, in a sign of the continual onward march of time, when I went to stumbleupon.com I found that it was rebranded to something called Mix.

The Chrome extension is pretty cool, but I realized that there is probably a better way to find fun and random things to write about. Then I remembered the Wikipedia game that we used to play as a kid, where someone would give you a random Wikipedia page and you had to get to another un-related Wikipedia page within 6 clicks. Of course, there's a website for that now too: 6 Degrees of Freedom. Turns out the computers have come for our nonsensical games, too,

(I told you it was inevitable that there would be data science somewhere.) But I thought that this would be a great way to write about new topics that were outside of my usual area of expertise and understanding, so I started this series: WikiRoll! This post will be the first post in the series, so I'll start on a topic that I wanted to learn more about: Hanafuda, the Japanese card game. But from here, I'll pick a link/topic on the Hanafuda page and use that page as the topic for my next post in the series! This is just an experiment, so let me know if you have additional ideas/thoughts! Now, the reason you're here...

So I ran into Hanafuda because I just finished the first season of the anime
